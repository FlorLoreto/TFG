Standard Template.

If you create your first project, we recommend you start with the "Standard_With_Some_Data" template. 
It is filled with dummy examples (activity 1, Work product 1...) that may help you to structure your process items and that can be removed later.

Do not forget to add domains and disciplines if you have several processes you want to organize.
